In boundary representations (BRep), objects are defined by vertices connected by edges and faces. In function representations (FRep), objects are defined by a function f that maps any point (x,y,z) to a real value d, the distance to the objects: f(x,y,z)=d\n\nThe components are organized in groups. A typical workflow is to choose objects from PRIMITIVES, combine them using e.g. Boolean operations from COMBINATIONS, add further MODIFICATIONS as necessary and finally visualize the distance object using a component from the MESHING tab. Furthermore, there are different kinds of LATTICES, some MATH functions, components to convert Rhino GEOMETRY into an SDF and some utilities to ANALYSE the SDF.",

As such, though, general caveats apply: it’s probably easy to break, and it will definitely generate some artifacts.

Dendro includes components for boolean, smoothing, offsets, and morphing operations. \n\nWhen working with meshes or Breps, these types of operations are often computationally heavy, prone to failures, or cannot handle complex geometry. OpenVDB's volume data structures allow for quicker computation with higher repeatability, enabling you to leverage more complex operations within Grasshopper. \n\nThe goal was to make Dendro integrate into Grasshopper as seamlessly as possible. Whereas many voxel solutions require you to think of geometry as living with a bounding box, Dendro makes working with volumes no different than handling any other geometry in Grasshopper. Dendro works with many native Grasshopper components, avoiding the 'blocking' found in other plugins, and allowing you to move in and out of volume operations very quickly.",

Available to be used to prepare and print models in a 'Plug and Play' style with Droid components, or in a more controlled and experimental manner with Custom input and output print paths.\n\nDroid allows control over conventional Slicing features such as infill, shell thickness and caps, within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment. In addition, output and editing of paths is also available once models are sliced into the Rhino and Grasshopper workspace, allowing full control and analysis to the user.\nCustom or edited paths then can be input back into Droid for Gcode preparation and generation.\n\nThis should work with most major firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, RepRap, etc) and Gcode Reader. If you use a firmware and encounter any problems related to Gcode, let me know.\n\nDroid Components are Multi-Thread enabled, and may use all your processors resources during calculations.",

Elefront allows users to bake geometry to the Rhino model with the option of specifying attributes, including an unlimited amount of user defined attributes by means of key-value pairs. This way it is possible to treat a 3d Rhino model as a data base, where each object \"knows\" what it is, what it belongs to, which other object it relates to and in what way, what its size is, when it needs to be fabricated etc. Instead of trying to store geometry in a database, Elefront stores data in an \"Geometrybase\", hereby turning your Rhino model into a \"Building Information Model\" or BIM, for short. This data can be used for analysis, but also for referencing objects back into Grasshopper, based on one or more filters defined by key-value pairs that were defined upon baking, or that were added to the geometry with the \"modify Rhino attributes\" component. Storing all data inside Rhino geometry, will enable you to split up your Grasshopper process into manageable portions that multiple users can now use as input for further Grasshopper development.",

Meshes are generated from four lists of angle arrays, describing the direction angles and fold angles for two sides of the mesh respectivly. The 'direction angle' is the ccw angle between the fold line and x-axis in xy-plane, while the 'fold angle' is the angle between the faces on either side of the crease in the fully folded state of the mesh.",

(Various papers with benchmark results are availabe here.) RBFMOpt won the “2-Objective Expensive” track of the international Black Box Optimization Competition 2019, surpassing the winner of the previous two years, the commercial algorithm Artelys Nitro.\n\nOpossum's GUI is similar to Galapagos.

This is made possible due to the speed increases afforded by the use of the point cloud class. For example, a full point cloud from a Kinect V2 is released in approximately 10-20ms on standard machines, which is more than enough for most purposes. A multi-threaded KD-Tree is also implemented to allow very fast spatial searching.",

Topologic is designed as a core library and additional plugins to visual data flow programming (VDFP) applications and parametric modelling platforms commonly used in architectural design practice. These applications provide workspaces with visual programming nodes and connections for architects to interact with Topologic and perform architectural design and analysis tasks.\n\nTopologic is well-suited to create a lightweight representation of a building as an external envelope and the subdivision of the enclosed space into separate spaces and zones using zero-thickness internal surfaces. Because Topologic maintains topological consistency, a user can query these cellular spaces and surfaces regarding their topological data and thus conduct various analyses. For example, this lightweight and consistent representation was found to be well-matched with the input data requirements for energy analysis simulation software. Because Topologic allows entities with mixed dimensionalities and those that are optionally independent (e.g. a line, a surface, a volume) to co-exist, structural models can be represented in a coherent manner where lines can represent columns and beams, surfaces can represent walls and slabs, and volumes can represent solids. In addition, non-building entities, such as structural loads can be efficiently attached to the structure. This creates a lightweight model that is well-matched with the input data requirements for structural analysis simulation software.",
