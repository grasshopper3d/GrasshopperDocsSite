In function representations (FRep), objects are defined by a function f that maps any point (x,y,z) to a real value d, the distance to the objects: f(x,y,z)=d\n\nThe components are organized in groups. A typical workflow is to choose objects from PRIMITIVES, combine them using e.g. Boolean operations from COMBINATIONS, add further MODIFICATIONS as necessary and finally visualize the distance object using a component from the MESHING tab. Furthermore, there are different kinds of LATTICES, some MATH functions, components to convert Rhino GEOMETRY into an SDF and some utilities to ANALYSE the SDF.",

Dendro works with many native Grasshopper components, avoiding the 'blocking' found in other plugins, and allowing you to move in and out of volume operations very quickly.",

In addition, output and editing of paths is also available once models are sliced into the Rhino and Grasshopper workspace, allowing full control and analysis to the user.\nCustom or edited paths then can be input back into Droid for Gcode preparation and generation.\n\nThis should work with most major firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, RepRap, etc) and Gcode Reader. If you use a firmware and encounter any problems related to Gcode, let me know.\n\nDroid Components are Multi-Thread enabled, and may use all your processors resources during calculations.",

This way it is possible to treat a 3d Rhino model as a data base, where each object \"knows\" what it is, what it belongs to, which other object it relates to and in what way, what its size is, when it needs to be fabricated etc. Instead of trying to store geometry in a database, Elefront stores data in an \"Geometrybase\", hereby turning your Rhino model into a \"Building Information Model\" or BIM, for short. This data can be used for analysis, but also for referencing objects back into Grasshopper, based on one or more filters defined by key-value pairs that were defined upon baking, or that were added to the geometry with the \"modify Rhino attributes\" component. Storing all data inside Rhino geometry, will enable you to split up your Grasshopper process into manageable portions that multiple users can now use as input for further Grasshopper development.",

Meshes are generated from four lists of angle arrays, describing the direction angles and fold angles for two sides of the mesh respectivly. The 'direction angle' is the ccw angle between the fold line and x-axis in xy-plane, while the 'fold angle' is the angle between the faces on either side of the crease in the fully folded state of the mesh.",

This duplicate is made available through a standard Grasshopper parameter output. The input of the component includes some custom programming to escape Grasshopper's recursive loop avoidance check. What this means in practice is that it is possible through the use of HoopSnake to send the output of a set of components back to it's input in a looping fashion. With the help of a little bit of Data Tree / Data List manipulation, this should open up some new possibilities for iterative process modeling.",

Extracting location, profiles, images and messages from Facebook,Twitter, Topsy etc….\n\nAs architects part of our responsibility is the consideration of the public realm. Today however , people tend to hang in the digital equivalent, namely, social media space. While this space becomes ever more permanent, the physical realm is fleeting, an evanescent space.\n\nWe are utilizing the tools in this component suite to bridge the gap between geometrics and information. Driving geometry with data and vice-versa. The ability to extract user Geo-coordinates, language, thoughts, profile and image enables architects to paint a picture. It is this  4-dimensional picture, which we refer to as “spatial condition”, that allows us to explore what happened yesterday, now and hypothesize about tomorrow. True 4-dimensional modeling.",

By using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, it provides an innovative and fast solution to the emerging architectural problem of Discrete aggregation for purposes of design, architecture and urban planning.\n\nMonoceros is an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm developed for game design by Maxim Gumin and extended and promoted by Oskar Stålberg with his game Townscaper. WFC is an algorithm that fills an entire spatial envelope with Modules in a meaningful way. The envelope is divided into discrete box-like Slots. The algorithm selects and places Modules into the Slots, making sure any two placed Modules can become neighbors (do have a common connector) according to specified Rules.\n\nDiscrete aggregation is one of the hottest approaches of computational design, along with the emergent swarm intelligence and AI. It recognizes small distinct parts that can be assembled into larger aggregates according to certain requirements. The parts are often represented by material components assembled using connectors. Most prominent discrete approaches are voxelization, discrete growth and constraint modeling, such as Wave Function Collapse.",

This is made possible due to the speed increases afforded by the use of the point cloud class. For example, a full point cloud from a Kinect V2 is released in approximately 10-20ms on standard machines, which is more than enough for most purposes.

Topologic is designed as a core library and additional plugins to visual data flow programming (VDFP) applications and parametric modelling platforms commonly used in architectural design practice. These applications provide workspaces with visual programming nodes and connections for architects to interact with Topologic and perform architectural design and analysis tasks.\n\nTopologic is well-suited to create a lightweight representation of a building as an external envelope and the subdivision of the enclosed space into separate spaces and zones using zero-thickness internal surfaces. Because Topologic maintains topological consistency, a user can query these cellular spaces and surfaces regarding their topological data and thus conduct various analyses. For example, this lightweight and consistent representation was found to be well-matched with the input data requirements for energy analysis simulation software. Because Topologic allows entities with mixed dimensionalities and those that are optionally independent (e.g. a line, a surface, a volume) to co-exist, structural models can be represented in a coherent manner where lines can represent columns and beams, surfaces can represent walls and slabs, and volumes can represent solids. In addition, non-building entities, such as structural loads can be efficiently attached to the structure. This creates a lightweight model that is well-matched with the input data requirements for structural analysis simulation software.",
